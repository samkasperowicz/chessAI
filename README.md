# chessBot
A chess robot personal project
To play, run main.py with python3 main.py
Choose a depth for AI, then enter moves using target square for pawns (ex: e4), and for other pieces and captures you must enter start square followed by target square (ex: e4f5).
Warning: Alpha Beta Pruning is not done yet, so higher depths will take a long time.
